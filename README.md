# First idea

Spotify playlist creation

As I'm listening music 24/7 in Spotify, I would like to create a model to predict and create playlists according to your musical taste. Maybe connect Streamlit with Spotify
Also, it could be an option to ask to the user the user name and password and generate that playlist. Furthermor, It would be nice if the user introduce a topic, i.e. 'Dance' and the playlist created is Dance. If the topic is not found, create a random list based in that topic

Data from API Spotify




# Second idea

Generate a model to predict if we are goint to have waves to surf in my local spot (of my little town in the Mediterranean Sea). I asked for the data to the web that provides a 12 days forecast of that precise place because I don't know if I could find the historical data. 

The goal would be not to know only if we are going to have waves, but also if we are going to have the big swell as we have a small sea and the big and good waves are not very common. Maybe one time in 2 years we have good waves and one time every 5 years we have amazing conditions.

It would be just my desired model but I don't know if I can perform this.
