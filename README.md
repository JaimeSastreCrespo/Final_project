## This repository contains the project I made for my graduation of the Bootcamp I attended in Ironhack Paris of Data analytics.


## Goal of the project:
                    - Analyse how the music has evolved over the years -> dataset of Kaggle with songs fromn 1920 to 2020 (not in this repository, too heavy +100 MB):             
                                                                                    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/javivaleiras/spotify-tracks-19202020
                    - Study how is my behavior listenint to music -> Spotify streaming history - request in your personal settings in your account
                    - Create a machine learning model that can predict a songâ€™s popularity.
